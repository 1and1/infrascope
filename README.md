# ![❂](https://raw.github.com/1and1/infrascope/master/doc/_static/infrascope-logo-36.png) infrascope — Infrastructure Transparency

`infrascope` closes the feedback loop for data generated by your
Infrastructure as Code, and delivery pipelines.
It generates visibility for the actual state of your deployments,
like versions of artifacts in your repositories and runtime environments.
